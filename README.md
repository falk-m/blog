# Blog

This blog is not for you, not only. 
Like other developers, I read articles, test new features, analyze code from others and so on.
Also, I have some interesting code snippets used in projects, if I need them, I always search in old projects.
This blog is my central place now, to collect interesting code snippets, features, etc.
