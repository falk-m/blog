## Links

- [quilljs](https://quilljs.com/) WYSIWYG Editor
- [cally](https://wicky.nillia.ms/cally/) calendar and date picking component

## inline-flex

I read in a other blox ```display: inline-flex``` and never heared about it before.    
[This codepen](https://codepen.io/clairecodes/pen/POjKXY) discripe the diffrence in compareison to ```display: flex```

## inert Attrebute

The [intent attrebute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) should do the same effect like the css code ```display: contents```.
It replaced the box with its child elements.
