This year, i visited the smart country conference in Berlin.    
Its a fair, where the main topic is the digitalization of the german coverment.    

My focus was the usage of open source and web technolgie in this area.

First intesting thing was the existance of a "Government Site Builder" based on Type3.    
[produkt.gsb.bund.de/gsb11](https://produkt.gsb.bund.de/gsb11).

Then I saw demonstrations op openDesk.    
[opendesk.eu](https://opendesk.eu/).    
Its a open source alternativ to microfot office suite.    
I saw a web based mail client and same office applications.

Nextcloud seems to be also a big thing for local government.    
[nextcloud.com](https://nextcloud.com/)

And i don't know that there a a accessibile web commponents library, supported and developt by the german coverment.
