I want to create a multistep HTML form. That means you have to input some data to access the next step and so on, until you can submit the form in the last step.

Requirements:

- form is normal usable when JS is disabled
- form is accessible (keyboard navigation, focus handling, ...)
- use native form validation

See here the [Demo](./demo.html) and the source code (in the same file).
