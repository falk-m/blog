This year, I visited the smart country conference in Berlin.    
It's a fair, where the main topic is the digitalization of the German government.    

My focus was the usage of open source and web technologies in this area.

First interesting thing was the existence of a "Government Site Builder" based on Type3.    
[produkt.gsb.bund.de/gsb11](https://produkt.gsb.bund.de/gsb11).

Then I saw demonstrations of openDesk.    
[opendesk.eu](https://opendesk.eu/).    
It's an open source alternative to Microsoft Office suite.    
I saw a web based mail client and same office applications.

Nextcloud seems to be also a big thing for local government.    
[nextcloud.com](https://nextcloud.com/)

And I don't know that there an accessible web components library, supported and developed by the German government.
